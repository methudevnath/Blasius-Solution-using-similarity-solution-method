# Blasius-Solution-using-similarity-solution-method

Similarity solution method is used to simplify the Navier Stokes equations governing the flow of a fluid over a plate 
to a single ordinary differential equation.

The ordinary differential equation is solved using the 4th order Runge-Kutta numerical method and necessary boundary conditions.

The problem is solved iteratively
