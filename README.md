# Blasius-Solution-using-similarity-solution-method

Similarity solution method is used to simplify the Navier Stokes equations governing the hydrodynamic boundary layer over a plate 
to a system of ordinary linear differential equations.

The system of ordinary differential equations are solved simultaneously using the 4th order Runge-Kutta numerical method and boundary conditions.

The problem is solved iteratively
